# Trailbase Erlang - An unofficial Erlang Client for Trailbase

[Trailbase](https://trailbase.io/) is an database as service on top of SQLite.
Think of it as an open-source Firebase alternative. It can be used as a quick easy-to-deploy back-office solution. We provide an Erlang client for Trailbase (and later other languages running on the BEAM).
